The check-balance part is optional! It's just for people to check their account balance!
You will need to go to https://yoursite.com/setup in order to run the setup script! It will not work without it!

I WILL NOT BE RESOLVING ISSUES ON HERE THIS IS PURELY FOR DEVELOPMENT WORK -- IF YOU CREATE AN ISSUE I MAY GET AROUND TO IT BUT IT'S NOT GUARENTEED


Please credit me if you use this, I'd appreciate it. The code is all open source though you may fork this or edit this as you wish and use it for yourself.


**IMPORTANT!!** There is sections that require you to input SQL data. I've set the credentials to default stuff but you will need to change this. It's the credentials for the database that hosts your pterodactyl panel!

ALL THE FILES SHOULD BE CORRECT. You will need to create directorys on your server that match the ones in this repository minus the IMPORTANT one, that one just tells you to edit your PayPal.php file.

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT, YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY CEARTAIN FILES

YOU CAN DO THIS IN THE index.php file in the main directory by making your own developer token and replacing it with the one that's in there right now!

The file in IMPORTANT/PayPal.php was created & coded by mubeen!
