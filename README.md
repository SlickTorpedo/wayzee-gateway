The token file will generate itself automatically don't worry!

The check-balance part is optional! It's just for people to check their account balance!
You will need to go to https://yoursite.com/setup in order to run the setup script! It will not work without it!

Please credit me if you use this, I'd appreciate it. The code is all open source though you may fork this or edit this as you wish and use it for yourself.

**IMPORTANT!!** There is sections that require you to input SQL data. I've set the credentials to default stuff but you will need to change this. It's the credentials for the database that hosts your pterodactyl panel!

ALL THE FILES SHOULD BE CORRECT. You will need to create directorys on your server that match the ones in this repository minus the IMPORTANT one, that one just tells you to edit your PayPal.php file.

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT, YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY CEARTAIN FILES
