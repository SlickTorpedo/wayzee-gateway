The token file will generate itself automatically don't worry!


I WILL NOT BE RESOLVING ISSUES ON HERE THIS IS PURELY FOR DEVELOPMENT WORK -- IF YOU CREATE AN ISSUE I MAY GET AROUND TO IT BUT IT'S NOT GUARENTEED


Please credit me if you use this, I'd appreciate it. The code is all open source though you may fork this or edit this as you wish and use it for yourself.


**IMPORTANT!!** There is sections that require you to input SQL data. I've set the credentials to default stuff but you will need to change this. It's the credentials for the database that hosts your pterodactyl panel!

ALL THE FILES IN THIS MAIN DIRECTORY NEED TO BE PLACED IN A FOLDER CALLED "payment-test"

IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT, YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY CEARTAIN FILES
